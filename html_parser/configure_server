#'html_extracting moduel' configured a lm-module

1. ssh-module
-> using the command at ~/.bash_profile : "alias ~"
2. install python on ubuntu
-> still need to do this!
3. git repository copy.
4. install pip and other packages
->sudo apt install python-pip



I fetched html_extractor from ascentnetworks git by copying necessary folders to the account.
